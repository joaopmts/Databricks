# Databricks Studies and Projects

This repository gathers content focused on data engineering with Databricks, covering data manipulation and analysis across multiple formats such as CSV, JSON, Parquet, ORC, and advanced table formats like Delta Lake and Apache Iceberg. It explores concepts of data reliability, versioning, time travel, and schema evolution, alongside the use of Python, Spark, and SQL for large-scale processing. It also includes exploratory data analysis with Spark and Pandas, as well as the development of machine learning models with MLlib for tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and recommendation systems. Another relevant aspect is the orchestration of cloud-based data pipelines, emphasizing automation, notebook scheduling, and integration across different stages of data workflows.
